Files added since last commit:

1. src/modules/categories/server/procedures.ts
   - Purpose: Contains backend logic for handling category-related operations
   - Explanation: This is where you define functions that handle database operations for categories 
   (like creating, reading, updating categories). Think of it as the "worker" that does the actual data handling.

2. src/trpc/client.tsx
   - Purpose: Creates the frontend connection to your backend API
   - Explanation: This sets up a "phone line" between your React components and your backend server. 
   It allows your frontend to call backend functions directly.

3. src/trpc/init.ts
   - Purpose: Initializes the tRPC setup
   - Explanation: This is like the "control center" that configures how your frontend and backend 
   communicate with each other.

4. src/trpc/query-client.ts
   - Purpose: Manages data fetching and caching
   - Explanation: This helps your app remember data it's already fetched, so it doesn't have to ask the 
   server again and again (like a smart notebook that remembers answers).

5. src/trpc/routers/_app.ts
   - Purpose: Combines all your API routes
   - Explanation: This is like a "directory" that lists all the different functions your backend can perform. 
   It organizes all your API endpoints in one place.

6. src/trpc/server.ts
   - Purpose: Creates the backend API server
   - Explanation: This is the "receptionist" of your backend - it receives requests from the frontend and routes 
   them to the correct functions.
